# Overview
The atsf project is created and maintained by Colin Johnson for two purposes:

1. Making his lovely girlfriend, Mary Jane, happy. Mary Jane is a student at UC Berkely extension and she likes Architecture and Interior Design.
2. Bringing Joy to others who live in or visit San Francisco

# What is atsf?
The atsf project provides information that allows you to take a self-guided Architecture Tour of San Francisco (hence: atsf)

# How it Works
I've divided San Francisco up into a number of different walking tours - each tour is represented by:

1. A layer on the "atsf" Google Map, located at: https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zrC2fkLoWUy4.knmXjFpA5xBc&usp=sharing
2. A directory within the atsf Project.

Within each neighborhood directory there are a number of files:

1. a README.md file that describes a walking tour in the given neighborhood.
2. a number of "site" files that describe the sites that are on the given walking tour.
